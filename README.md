# Experiments on Game of Life

_Since GoL has been around a long time, potentially all these experiments below have already been conducted. I did not thoroughly check._

## membrane life

add membranes around regional activity to
- potentially speed up computations (no computation necessary where nothing happens)
- better checkability for local stasis
- potentially adding an evolutionary aspect
    - for fun (watch simulation run)
    - see if very low-level computation, together with evolution, can bring about societal functions

## "quantum life"

randomness fluctuations as an add-on to Game of Life as a test whether this allows for a perpetual simulation

## ...?

potentially many more possibilies
